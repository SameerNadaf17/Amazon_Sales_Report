Conclusion:

In this analysis, we've explored several ways to visualize and analyze data related to revenue and shipping states, focusing on:

1. Handling Missing Data: We cleaned the dataset by ensuring that necessary columns, like Fulfilment and Revenue, did not contain missing    values. This was an essential step to ensure our data analysis was accurate.

2. Data Aggregation: By grouping the data by relevant columns (e.g., ship-state, Category, and Fulfilment), we were able to aggregate    
   revenue and get a clearer view of how different categories, states, and fulfillment methods contributed to overall revenue. This step     provided useful insights for further analysis.

3. Visualization:

  ->We used seaborn bar plots to visualize revenue by shipping state, where we applied different color schemes (like coolwarm and 
    viridis) to enhance the clarity of the graphs.

  ->Customizing the color palette helped to differentiate categories and visualize the data in a more interpretable manner. We also 
    applied gradients to represent revenue variations in an aesthetically pleasing way.

4. Key Insights:

  ->By sorting and aggregating data based on various categories (such as ship-state), we identified which states contributed the most to 
    the revenue. This kind of analysis is crucial for decision-making, such as identifying high-performing regions or categories that may     require more attention or focus.

  ->Using different color schemes enhanced the readability and visual appeal of the charts, making it easier to spot trends and outliers.
